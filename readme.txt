The first set of graphs let us see how carrying capacity, growth rate, 
and initial population sizes affected a population. The first graph 
shows that if growth rate is negative you converge on zero. If growth 
rate is positive you converge on the carrying capacity. As growth rate 
increases you approach carrying capacity more rapidly. The second graph 
shows that when you have different carrying capacities for different 
populations they each reach their own respective populations. The Third 
plot shows that your population always reaches the carrying capacity 
despite where you started (e.g. higher you go down, lower you go up.)
